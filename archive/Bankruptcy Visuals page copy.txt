Bankruptcy Visuals are available free of charge by download from this website.
Bankruptcy Visuals are available for Chapter 7 (liquidation), Chapter 11 (reorganization), and Chapter 13 (debt adjustment).
You may print copies of the Bankruptcy Visuals pursuant to a Creative Commons 4.0 NC BY ND license.  The terms of that license are available from Creative Commons. 
[David: I could figure out who the licenses are supposed to be implemented on a website.  I am hoping that you can.]  
The terms are:
  Attribution (BY)
Copies of the work must credit Lynn M. LoPucki as the author by reproducing the work with the attribution that appears on it.
  NonCommercial (NC)
You may copy, distribute, or display Bankruptcy Visuals only for a non-commercial purpose, unless you first obtain the permission of Lynn M. LoPucki.
  NoDerivatives (ND)
You may copy, distribute, or display Bankruptcy Visuals only in their complete, original form. To modify a Bankruptcy Visual, you must have the permission of Lynn M. LoPucki.

[Large download buttons for “Chapter 7” “Chapter 11” and “Chapter 13”]
[David: I would also like a separate page on which the user can view each of the visuals, zoom in an out, and scroll horizontally and vertically—similar to the one here http://www.bankruptcyvisuals.com/viewcharts.html.]
